Tetravex
========

What is Tetravex?
-----------------
**Tetravex** is a logic puzzle game that I can best describe as a **4-sided domino game on a grid**.

What is this repository?
------------------------
This repository is my **C# implementation** of Tetravex. It features random generation of solvable boards, solution peeking and a nice-looking semi-graphical interface, all packaged in a terminal application.

Where is this going?
--------------------
Right now, this game is mostly finished. There are a few tweaks I'd like to make (for example, you can't set your board size in the program. It's absolutely trivial to add, but for now they're just `const` fields hard-coded in the source code)  
A list of things I plan on doing:  
* Add board size customization
* Tweak the command system a little
* Clean up the code
* Publish a GitHub release
